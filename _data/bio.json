    "summary": "
Finding solutions has always been at the heart of my work. Whether that is planning out a multi-million dollar waiver program for unemployment benefits, or being able to optimize the backend queries, I enjoy getting to be part of an action-oriented team. I have experience working with Java, C#, SQL, and React. 
<br><br>
I was born and raised in Honolulu, HI and currently am based in the Greater Boston region. I received my B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Hawai'i Manoa and learned to love all things poke during my time there. After work, you can usually find me following the newest Zelda updates, practicing my Korean and Chinese, or making a mean tonkatsu while my cat Lilikoi watches. I'm always open to chatting about collaborations, the newest gaming updates, or a good comedy show.
