## Introduction to Accessibility

I served as an Assistant Web Editor for JABSOM to create and maintain department sites from September 2019 to April 2020. Around this time, there was a big push for content updates and accessiblity, the latter being an unfamiliar subject to me. 

One of my first responsiblities in this role was learning and understanding the importance of accessiblity. Learning about the importance of color contrast, alt text, image descriptions, screen reader capabilities, and captioning helped me develop a more cohesive perspective on developing products. It had never occurred to me that some people did not have the same able-bodied privileges as I had, and I quickly understood why JABSOM, a medical school facility, needed new tools to make their multisite accessible to all. 

## Highlights

1. Our team created a screen-reader plugin that would enable tables and headings to be screen-reader compatible.

2. We developed a plugin that would parse public book data dynamically for one of the department's sites. 

3. I created 12 separate websites for JABSOM departments that needed a facelift. It was exciting to bring a couple of these sites out of the last decade into modernity! 

## Reflections

Understanding accessibility measures is necessary from the start of any project development. Whether the project is web or mobile-based, it should be designed for all people, regardless of their age, language, location, ability, or abilities. Developing a deeper understanding of the challenges people with disabilities may face when trying to access the web, such as vision impairment, hearing loss, or limited mobility made me a stronger developer and advocate when creating these resources.

Here are some resources that helped me learn more about this function:
