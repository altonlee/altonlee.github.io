## Introduction to Accessibility

During my time as a student at UH Manoa, I was onboarded as an Assistant Web Editor for JABSOM to create and maintain department sites. Around this time, there was a big push for content updates and accessiblity, the latter being an unfamiliar subject to me. 

One of my first responsiblities in this role was learning and understanding the importance of accessiblity. It had never occurred to me that some people did not have the same able-bodied privileges as I had, and I quickly understood why JABSOM, a medical school facility, needed new tools to make their multisite accessible to all. 

We created a screen-reader plugin that would enable tables and headings to be screen-reader compatible, and a another plugin that would parse public book data dynamically for one of the department's sites. 

Aside from the fancy plugin stuff, I also created separate websites for JABSOM departments that needed a facelift. I would say I brought a couple of these sites out of the last decade into modernity! 

My biggest takeaway from my time here was keeping into account for accessibility, and is one of my core principles when building any sort of web application.
