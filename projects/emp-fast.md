## Hello, Mt. Rainier!

In July 2020 I was onboarded as an Implementation Consultant (ICs) for FAST Enterprises and was assigned an unemployment insurance (UI) project site based in Olympia, WA. During this time the world had seen unprecedented counts of unemployment, and thus Washington's UI program desparately needed an upgrade. After touching down in Washington state I collaborated remotely with subject matter experts (SMEs), stakeholders, and fellow ICs to upgrade the current system to accomadate the ever-evolving UI policies and capacity of unemployment registrations. 

My day-to-day responsibilities generally included: 

1. Resolving server requests, usually implementing a code or config change to fix a site issue reported by stakeholders. Server requests ranged in severity, colloquially termed "T-Shirt Sizes". Turnaround time for these server requests were typically two weeks, starting from developing in a local environment to testing in a production-like environment with unit testing. Test scenarios were provided by the developers and given to SMEs for thorough testing. 

2. Information gathering, which mainly consisted of querying against data tables for claimant data, unemployment benefit amounts, entitlement types, and/or other data. These reports are typically used to decide policies way above my paygrade, so precision and accuracy are always a priority. 

3. Knowledge transfer & mentorship. Many project sites trade ICs across other sites depending on state/project urgency, so an IC does not stick around one site for long. Because of this, it was important for every IC to share and learn knowledge about site politics and policies, along with current system kinks and ongoing projects.
