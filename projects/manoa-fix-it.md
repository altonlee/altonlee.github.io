## Introduction

For this project we were tasked to build an app that handles high traffic volume and database management. I collaborated with a peer at UH Manoa to build an app that aims to capture campus-related issues and document progress for campus-wide transparency. 

Check out the video below to see the app in action!

## Highlights

1. Ran user research and presented a pitch for the app to administrators.
2. Created a user-friendly submission process that can be accomplished in less than five minutes. 
3. Issues were displayed on cards for easy visiblitity, and a "Like" system was implemented to sort requests by popularity/urgency.

## Development

We storyboarded the layout of the mobile app first, since the main user interaction would take place there. We had a rough idea of having popular issues rise to the top of the feed, so users could vote on issues that were important to the user demographic. We also opted to have a separate complaints list so users can submit suggestions or frustrations. 

The app was developed using Android SDK and the Java Source, and builds were made with mobile devices in mind. As this was the team's first time building a mobile app, we did run into issues with connecting to our local database and in-app navigation. Luckily, we were solely focused on Android development at the time, so we did not have any issues with compatibility. 

The web-based admin functionality was developed with JS React and Semantic UI and is designed after the main UH branch's aesthetics. The site would do a SQL query for either issues or complaints and sort based on user-reported urgency. As of writing the site functionality is merely a mock-up and has potential to grow.

## Final Thoughts

Our inspiration for this app was UH Manoa's Computer Science building notoriously having broken doors. After personally having to deal with broken doors for four years, but no streamlined way of reporting this issue, we wanted to bring this solution to life. Understanding the solutions-oriented way of problem-solving, and speaking with people directly impacted by the problem helped us understand the most efficient solution. 

Our target demographic for this app are students and professors who use campus facilities regularly. As long as there are issues on campus, and there are students that enter the UH system, there will always be new users on the app. Understanding our demographic is always key when developing solutions for them, as well as taking advantage of growth opportunities. 

Although this app was never officially deployed, we had positive feedback from our professor and peers. The efficiency, usability, and sort features were highlighted in our feedback surveys.
